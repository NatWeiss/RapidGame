Notes for Windows by Sam
------------------------
Don't forget:

- You'll want to make this a new release (0.9.9 or even 1.0) after merging
- Update CHANGELOG.txt
- The Windows template project still does not compile and should be fixed at some point

Add to README:

- Android is now fully functional on Windows! (from prebuilding libraries to building .apk's, all using the standard commands)
- I highly recommend adding the "rapidgame must be run in an admin console if on Windows" bit to the "Build a Game in Under 30 Seconds" section
	-> Something like:
		=> And, create a cocos2d-x game named "HeckYeah":
		=> rapidgame create cocos2dx "HeckYeah" org.myorg.heckyeah
		=> Make sure to run Command Prompt or Cygwin as administrator when doing this on Windows!
	-> This is especially important the first time, as that is when latest is created
		=> If running as root on Windows the first time, latest will be created as a symlink as intended, otherwise it will be a regular folder
	-> You don't need to run "npm install rapidgame -g" in a root console on Windows, so this line should be changed to leave off the bit at the end:
		=> "Or, on Windows leave off the `sudo` --and use an administrative console--"
- There is no longer any 64-bit requirement for Windows (remove the 64-bit part for Cygwin under Windows Notes)
- When building an Android project with "make", the command must be run in a cygwin console if on Windows
	-> You must manually set a couple environment variables first in ~/.bash_profile
		=> cd ~
		=> [text editor: e.g. nano] .bash_profile
		=> go to bottom of file
		=> type "ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=C:/path/to/sdk" (forward slashes are a must, the line does not contain quotes itself)
		=> next line type "NDK_ROOT=C:/path/to/ndk" (forward slashes are a must, the line does not contain quotes itself)
		=> save, exit editor, restart cygwin, good to go for all future projects
- (Both Mac and Win) Android SDK's APIs must be downloaded for the target platform and for the minimum supported platform
	-> TwoScene's current default target is API 18, and the minimum is API 10
	-> This can be done by going to Android Studio -> Configure -> SDK Manager -> [Select and install appropriate packages]

Technical details:

- rapidgame/src/proj.android/makefile was modified in order to run the Android library build commands in startBuild() in rapidgame.js (Windows only)
	-> prebuildAndroid() was modified as well so that only one build is pushed (for both standard build and minimal build) if on Windows
	-> This is because startBuild() runs "make" or "make minimal" in rapidgame/src/proj.android instead of running build.sh each time for each target
- Removed "cocos_protobuf-lite_static" from build.sh at the bottom from the list of directories, as it is no longer used doing the build process
- build.sh no longer hardcodes paths for ar, strip, and dest for any platform
- Changed every call of util.print() to console.log() in rapidgame.js to eliminate annoying messages for verbose output

Future fixes:

- I may try to get the Windows project compiling at some point, but I'm satisfied with rapidgame's functionality for right now
